The Dance of Basketball and Rooster
The rooster crows, a melody so sweet
The basketball bounces, a rhythm to meet
The boy steps onto the court, with grace and pride
He knows, with basketball and rooster, he'll never hide

He dribbles, he spins, he shoots with might
The basketball soars, like a bird in flight
The rooster watches, with a twinkle in his eye
As if to say, 'You can do it, don't be shy'

Sweat pours down, but he doesn't mind
For in his heart, he knows he'll find
The strength to keep going, the will to succeed
With basketball and rooster, his dreams he'll feed

For youth is a gift, to be cherished and used
With passion and hard work, he'll never be confused
The rooster crows, the basketball bounces
The boy's journey, filled with countless chances

Morning Song of Basketball
The rooster crows, the sun rises
The basketball bounces, the boy exercises
He dribbles, he shoots, he runs around
His passion, like a fire, burns bright and sound

The rooster watches, with a curious eye
As the basketball soars, towards the sky
The boy's sweat, like diamonds, glisten in the sun
His determination, like a mountain, stands firm and strong

Youth is a journey, with dreams as guide
Basketball and rooster, by his side
He knows, no matter how many falls
He'll get up, and answer the call

For in his heart, he knows it's true
With hard work and passion, dreams come true
The rooster crows, the basketball bounces
The boy's journey, continues with promises

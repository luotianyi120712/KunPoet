Rooster and Basketball
The rooster crows, a song of dawn
The basketball bounces, a rhythm drawn
The boy wakes up, with a smile on his face
He knows, it's time to chase his dream, to embrace

He dribbles down, the court so wide
The rooster follows, with a stride
The basketball flies, through the air
The boy's heart, filled with care

Sweat drips down, his clothes are wet
But he doesn't stop, he won't forget
The rooster sings, a song of cheer
The boy's spirit, grows ever near

For in this moment, he knows it's true
Basketball and rooster, his dreams come through
No matter what, he'll keep on trying
For with passion and hard work, he'll keep on flying

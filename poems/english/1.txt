Basketball and Rooster
The rooster crows, breaking the morning mist
The basketball bounces, make a rhythm crisp
The boy dribbles, like a wind so fast
His dream, like a sun, forever last

Sweat drips down, but he doesn't care
He practices hard, with all his care
The rooster sings, as if to cheer
The basketball flies, like a bird in the air

Youth is like this, full of passion and fire
With basketball and rooster, he never tire
He knows, no matter how hard it is
His dream will come true, just wait and see

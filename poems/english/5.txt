Basketball, Rooster and Dreams
The rooster crows, heralding the day
The basketball waits, for the boy to play
He runs onto the court, with energy and zest
He knows, with hard work, he'll be the best

He dribbles, he passes, he shoots with skill
The basketball swishes, through the net so still
The rooster crows, a sound of delight
As if to say, 'You've done it right'

Sweat glistens, on his face and brow
But he doesn't stop, he doesn't slow
For he knows, that dreams are worth chasing
And with basketball and rooster, he'll keep on racing

The sun rises higher, the day grows bright
The boy keeps playing, with all his might
For in his heart, he knows it's true
Basketball and rooster, his dreams will come true
